description: "Our next stop was Dover to see the castle and the white cliffs. It looked from the map that we could wakl to the castle. However, when we got to Dover we had two obstacles: although we could clearly see the castle from the middle of town, we couldn't figure out how to walk to it; and secondly, it looked like quite a hike up a cliff to get to the castle. We were already pretty tired, so we hired a cab. We learned that our fears were well founded. We never would have found it and the ride was pretty long and steep."

We later learned that almost everyone takes a car to Dover Castle and parks on the other side. We must have been one of the few or only visitors to come in through the pedestrian entrance.</para></p>

The man at the ticket booth told us to hurry to make the next tour. Our walk took us up to the top of the castle grounds and then back down the other side to the entrance of the caves. We did our best to avoid any sight-seeing so as not to delay our trip. We ended up arriving quite early, so I had some water in the cafe.</para></p>

<p><para para_guid="bcf8c5e8-f5b5-4e4f-97a8-c5befdba9528">The trip through the caves was a lot of fun. The caves are a three level system of underground caverns built into the cliffs. Dover was a major air base during WWII, so they had used the caves for intelligence, living quarters, and makeshift hospital. The tour was conducted by a single individual that would press buttons throughout the caves that would simulate bombs being dropped above us - the lights would flicker, we'd hear thunderous sounds, and the air raid sirens would go off. There was one small girl that took the whole thing very seriously and became quite afraid. You lose all sense of direction in the tunnels.</para></p>

There's a 3 mile walk along the cliffs, but I was getting pretty tired of walking at this point, and it seemed that we wanted to see the cliffs from below, not walk on them. We decided to walk down to the piers and get a view of them from below - possibly from a tour boat.</para></p>

We almost made a tour boat, but when I saw that it was packed and full of little kids, I vetoed the idea. We could admire the cliffs from where we were standing.</para></p>
