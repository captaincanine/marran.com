description: Our first day in Prague was really two. We left the house a little late, and than found out that we were dealing with rain, holiday weekend, and Friday afternoon traffic. We got to the airport as they were boarding the flight - in fact, it was mostly full when we got there. So we got two middle seats. For an over night flight. Yay. However, the flight to Zurich went relatively quickly. we had a five hour layover in Zurich, and we saw something about day rooms. So we decided to check them out. They were very white, sterile rooms with a communal toilet and Shower down the hall.

<p>Our first day in Prague was really two. We left the house a little late, and than found out that we were dealing with rain, holiday weekend, and Friday afternoon traffic. We got to the airport as they were boarding the flight - in fact, it was mostly full when we got there. So we got two middle seats. For an over night flight. Yay. However, the flight to Zurich went relatively quickly. we had a five hour layover in Zurich, and we saw something about day rooms. So we decided to check them out. They were very white, sterile rooms with a communal toilet and Shower down the hall. We were so dead tired, we decided to rent one. And it turns out they made quite a difference. Waking up was sheer torture, but once I was up, I felt distinctly better. Also, the shower felt fantastic.</p>

<p>The Swiss Air flight was a wonderful welcome to Europe. They served a fantastic smoked ham and herb cheese sandwich followed by Swiss chocolates. I looked at David and commented on the food in Europe. He said, "Low fat. What's that?"</p>
