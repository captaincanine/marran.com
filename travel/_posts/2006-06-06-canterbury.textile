description: David and I got up relatively early to catch a train to go to Canterbury. It felt like we could have slept for days. England has a fantastic train system. You can get pretty much anywhere you need to get to by train and they run on time. The only drawback on taking the trains going south during the summer is that you're getting family beach crowds. We got stuck next to two loud groups on the train, but that didn't stop us from getting a little nap in on the way there.

It seemed to be a big destination for teenagers - there were lots of kids hanging out in the park, and lots of families strolling around the shops. We headed right to the cathedral, which is the big attraction.</para></p>

In fact, the only reason that the cathedral is still standing is because the Germans had poor maps of England. The locals in Kent would also light fires out in the middle of nowhere to try to trick the Germans into thinking the targets were in a different place.</para></p>
