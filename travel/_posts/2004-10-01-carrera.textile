description: After Pisa, we drove up to Carrera (the place with the marble!). Once again, quaint medieval town. Unfortunately, most everything was closed there. We saw some workers carving marble and took a picture. They let us know that that was not cool. Obviously, we looked like tourists, so they weren't too worried, but I did put the camera away.

<p>After Carrera, we took the scenic route to our next stop. That meant driving up and over one of the Italian Alps. The views were fantastic. We didn't take any pictures. The road was dotted with occasional road-side hotels, but for the most part, there was absolutely no one around.</p>
