description: I feel repetitive saying that this Lucca is a beautiful, medieval town. All of these towns have their own personality and should be experienced. This town has a cosmoploitan heart to it. Once we hit the main area, we found that it was full of small streets with shops galore.

<p>Lucca is the birthplace of opera composer Giacomo Puccini (he wrote Madama Butterfly, La Boheme, and Turandot for all you cultural heathens). The had a museum of his house which was more interesting than one would imagine. David bought a first print of a score there.</p>
