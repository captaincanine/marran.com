<p>We got a relatively early start this morning. David was anxious to get out of the "Miami 

Beach" atmosphere of Nice and on to the provincial setting of Provence. We picked up a 

rented car and with David as the navigator and myself as the driver, we went to Aix-en-

Provence. I think it took us around two hours. After we checked into the hotel, we went 

for a brief walking tour. Almost every town in Provence has an office of tourism with 

maps of the town, things to do, etc. After getting a lot of maps and a pass to all of the 

museums, went for a walk around the town. Aix has a beautiful old city, so we wandered 

the medieval streets and went into a few small museums. It is also known as the city of a 

thousand fountains. We turned out to be rather tired, so after some touring, we went back 

to the hotel room and took a nap. For dinner, we ate outside in a public square. A lot of 

the cafes and restaurants are only big enough for the kitchen and the staff and the seating 

is outside.</p>
