description: The Thames boat ride stopped in Greenwich where we disembarked. Greenwich is a small community with cafes, shops, an antiques market, the Royal Observatory, and a whole bunch of other things. You can visit this website for more information. We didn't do half of the things listed there.

We went to a place serving very English food and had a good lunch. While we were there some obnoxious older American gentleman came in, demanded attention, and then was talking to his guests about how hard it is to find polite people in the U.K. Ugh.</para></p>

You can stand on a line and have one foot in the eastern hemisphere and one foot in the western hemisphere. In the picture below, you can see The Queen's House in the center and just above to the right is the Royal Observatory. The walk there is a bit steep at the very end, but through a park that was full of people enjoying their Sunday afternoon.</para></p>

On my travails, I went back to the main pier. There were many street performers - most of whom did not seem to be asking for money at all. Next to where I sat came two people dressed like colorful 1950's shysters with a peep show box. They played music and encouraged people to come up and take a look in the peep show box. The man was saying harmless but lewd things about what you'd see if you looked. Both children and adults were smiling and laughing after they looked, so I decided to get in line and have a look myself. It was a gyrating puppet of an old woman with tassels on her breasts and tiny underwear. </para></p>
