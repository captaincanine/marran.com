description: "I used to think that Santorini was the ideal honeymoon location: I'm now convinced that the ideal spot is St. Paul de Vence. It's a small walled city that is inland from the rest of the Cote D'Azur coastal resorts, high on a hill. The streets are winding and confusing, but the only thing to do is wander around and look at shops. It was primarily art galleries, but we also found some cloth shops, candy shops, spice shops, and a fantastic shop that had all sorts of homemade liqueurs. We sampled and bought fig, blueberry, and red peach liqueurs."

<p>I used to think that Santorini was the ideal honeymoon location: I'm now convinced that 

the ideal spot is St. Paul de Vence. It's a small walled city that is inland from the rest of 

the Cote D'Azur coastal resorts, high on a hill. The streets are winding and confusing, but 

the only thing to do is wander around and look at shops. It was primarily art galleries, but 

we also found some cloth shops, candy shops, spice shops, and a fantastic shop that had 

all sorts of homemade liqueurs. We sampled and bought fig, blueberry, and red peach 

liqueurs.</p>

<p>We spent a half hour walking to the Fondation Maeght and discovered that it had just 

closed for lunch. We looked at the artwork on the grounds, decided it looked too much 

like a 1960's suburban synagogue, and walked back to St. Paul de Vence for lunch. We 

did a little more touring of the town, including a stop for crepes, and then headed back to 

the city.</p>

<p>For dinner, we went to L'Auberge de Acropolis, which is a very local restaurant off the 

beaten path. No one in the restaurant spoke anything but French. The owner was very 

frustrated that he could not communicate with us, as he was extremely sociable with 

everyone else. We had a very good food translation section in one of our guidebooks, so 

we knew more or less what we were ordering. There was a man eating alone next to us 

that also only spoke French, trying to make pleasant conversation. We told him we were 

from New York City. At one point it sounding like he said "Boosh" (as in G. W.) and 

made hand signals that led us to believe that he was offering condolences for the World 

Trade Center attack. He gave as some of his grappas, an extremely potent grape liqueur, 

and we toasted his hospitality, using most of David's twelve words of French vocabulary. 

The owner's lovable german shepherd sat in the corner and came over once for some 

affection.  Or was it to lick the food off my hand?</p>
