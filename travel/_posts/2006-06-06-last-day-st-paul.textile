description: We didn't have much time on our last full day. I wanted to do just a little bit of shopping and David wanted to visit St. Paul's Cathedral. We decided that we could easily do both. I had found a store on the internet that sold Indian things and there was a music store that specialized in musicals and soundtracks that were near each other. We took the underground to close to the neighborhood, but left a lot of time for walking. It was a nice day for it.

I took a picture. I wanted to go knock on the door and tell the residents that we expected great literary achievements from anyone that lived here, but David stopped me.</para></p>

And we made it to the music store but I wasn't feeling too inspired to buy anything. So it was on to St. Paul's.</para></p>

<p><para para_guid="81da59a9-7269-48de-a0f6-79ed384896be">I don't have many pictures of St Paul's because you're not allowed to take pictures once you're inside. However, I found a little section where there were no monitors roaming around and the view was too beautiful to resist taking a picture.</para></p>

<p><para para_guid="c2c7d42f-131d-4a86-b532-a10d34b42e60">I had been to St. Paul's many years ago by myself - on a long layover. I remember being not that impressed. What the hell was up with me that day? It's a beautiful cathedral. I think there must have been some construction or renovation going on to stop my from seeing all of it, because I was mightily impressed going through it with David.</para></p>
