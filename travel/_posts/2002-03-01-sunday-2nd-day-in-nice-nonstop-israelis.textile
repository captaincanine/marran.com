<p>I barely remember waking up enough to join David for breakfast. I went back to the hotel 

room, took a little post-breakfast nap, a long bath, and then decided to greet the day. I 

took a walk through Old Nice again, going a little closer to the coast. I ended up at 

Promenade des Anglais and walked through the open market. They had fruit stands, 

flower strands, marzipan fruit stands, and spice stands with every spice you could 

imagine. David called me on my cell phone and said that he had time to do lunch. We 

met in the area of the open market for an uneventful but delicious lunch.</p>

</div>

<p>After lunch I decided to go to the Musée Chagall. I left the hotel and in one block 

realized I was lost. I took a new direction and discovered in two blocks, I was still lost. I 

eventually did get there, but I took many wrong turns and probably spent twice as much 

time walking as was necessary. The visit was well worth it. This particular museum was 

dedicated to images of the Old Testament. I always thought Chagall's work was 

interesting, but seeing his work together, especially the 17 images of the Biblical 

Message, made me a convert. After the museum visit, I knew the direction that the hotel 

was in, so I decided to be lost for a while. I wandered around a wealthy section of town 

looking at houses before heading back to the hotel.</p>

<p>David finished his conference duties about the same time I got back. His presentation 

went well. We decided to take a walk up to the town park, which is high on a bluff. There 

are some ruins and a large, planned waterfall that can be seen from pretty much any point 

in the city. On the way up, we ran into an Israeli colleague of David's. The park also has 

two cemeteries: one of which is a Jewish cemetery. Both cemeteries were closed, but we 

peeked in and were very impressed with what we saw.</p>

<p>After the park excursion, we met two other Israelis, Benny and Chanah, for dinner. We 

went to a restaurant that served primarily seafood for dinner along the Promenade des 

Anglais. I had a fantastic grilled lobster - they threw in some fennel. Fantastique!</p>
