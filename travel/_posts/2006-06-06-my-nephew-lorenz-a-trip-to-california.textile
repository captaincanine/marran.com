description: Lorenz and Sis recently went to Yuba City, California for Aunt Beth's 50th Birthday party. I believe that most everyone of the Everett clan was there, so it was a chance for Lorenz to see what he's in store for him. And also for Sis to see her relatives and probably get teased for being short. Unfortunately, I wasn't there, so I don't have the full scoop. But Mom sent me these pictures of Lorenz. And the other big unfortunate is that there is a great picture of Lorenz with a huge smile, but the photo came out blurry.
