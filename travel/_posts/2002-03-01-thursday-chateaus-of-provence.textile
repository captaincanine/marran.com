<p>Today we started by driving out to hit some of the chateaux (castles) of the area. We went 

to Chateau Barben, which is right next to the local zoo. The grounds were fantastic, but 

the only way to see it was to go with the tour, which we had just missed. We decided to 

come back.</p>

<p>Our next stop was Le Beaux, which is another walled village, high on a mountaintop. The 

views were stunning, but by this time, we were actually starting to get picky about our 

mega-quaint, medieval, walled villages. We did a bit of touring, had a magnificent lunch, 

and took the slow road back to Chateau Barben. We got the tour of the Chateau, which 

has, of course, spectacular views. Many of the rooms were very well stocked with period 

furniture. One of the highlights was a room that was wallpapered with leather. The 

leather had designs imprinted upon it and was original to the Chateau.</p>

<p>We returned to Aix and did a little shopping. I found a kitchen supply store and went a 

little nuts.</p>

<p>For dinner that evening, we had one of the best meals I've had in my life. I started with a 

cream of leak soup that had tomatoes and sausage in it. My main course was a steak 

stuffed with foie gras, served with green onions wrapped in bacon. And dessert was 

unbelievable: it was four small desserts based on a chestnut theme. There was chestnut 

mousse, chestnut créme brulee, some sort of chestnut pudding in a shot glass with 

whipped cream, and chestnut ice cream. I can't remember what David had other than the 

foie gras for an appetizer. After his first bite, he said, "I am ordering foie gras at every 

meal from now on."</p>
