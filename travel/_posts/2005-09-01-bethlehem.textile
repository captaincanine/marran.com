description: The morning of our last full day in Israel, I went to Bethlehem. This was a big deal for a few different reasons. First of all, it's the birthplace of Jesus Christ. Secondly, it was the place that I had a dream about several months prior to visitting it. And thirdly, it was in the West Bank under Palestinian control. Israeli tour guides are not allowed to go into the West Bank for security reasons, so if you want to go, you have to figure out how to get there. There are tours that go there, but I couldn't find any.

<p>The morning of our last full day in Israel, I went to Bethlehem. This was a big deal for a few different reasons. First of all, it's the birthplace of Jesus Christ. Secondly, it was the place that I had a dream about several months prior to visitting it. And thirdly, it was in the West Bank under Palestinian control. Israeli tour guides are not allowed to go into the West Bank for security reasons, so if you want to go, you have to figure out how to get there. There are tours that go there, but I couldn't find any. You will occasionally hear someone on the street say that they are willing to take you to Bethlehem, but I don't want to go with a stranger for obvious reasons. Our tour guide from the Via Dolorosa, Jaliel, offered to take me, so I took him up on it. David did not go because he did not want to make himself a target to angry Palestinians. However, tourists have rarely, if ever, been a target for terrorism in Israel.</p>

<p>I met Jaliel in Old Jerusalem. He took me through into East Jerusalem, the muslim part of town, to get a shared taxi that would take us to the West Bank. A shared taxi fits between 10-20 people. It's a little bigger than a mini-van. I was quite obviously the only non-arab on the taxi. Although Bethlehem is only a 15 minute drive away from Jerusalem, we had to go through Israel checkpoints to get there and since the wall had been built, we had to use an indirect road to get into Bethlehem. Before the Israeli guard got on the bus to check passports, Jaliel asked me to NOT say that I was going to Bethlehem. He told me to say that we were visitting friends in Gosh Etsyon. He said that the guards don't like to hear that tourist are going to Bethlehem, but I think there was some other reason. Still, I was already nervous at that point and the thought of being told to lie to an Israeli guard in full military gear was not making me feel at ease. Luckily, the guard didn't ask. The shared taxi went on for a while and we got off at a non-descript stop in the street. There was no sign, no house, it just seemed like a dirt road. But we found a taxi right away that took us to Bethlehem where I met a certified Palestinian tour guide that took me to the Church of the Nativity.</p>

<p>And now on to the Church of the Nativity. First of all, it's the ONLY church in Israel that was not destroyed by the Syrians in the 6th century. When the Syrians came to destroy all the churches, they saw the mosaics in the Church of the Nativity and saw the wise men in Syrian dress and thought it was a Syrian church. Secondly, the visit to this church was right out of my dream. As soon as I saw the entrance to the church, I had a slight freak-out, because it was right out of my dream. You have to duck to go into the church to make you humble and to keep camels and horses out of the church.</p>

<p>The inside of the church is beautiful. Unfortunately, almost every photo I took came out incredibly blurry. I don't know if this is God's doing or Sony's. My guide took me down to the area where Christ was born. He said we only have a few minutes between the Catholic mass and the Armenian mass to visit the birthplace, which we did. Once again, I felt the vibrations of being in a holy location. It was incredible. And I had another moment of seeing something that was in my dream.</p>

<p>After visiting the church, we went back to a souvenir shop (whenever you have a tour guide, your tour will end up at a souvenir shop), I bought some things to support the local economy and had some mint tea. The Palestinians were extremely friendly and less pushy than I had been used to. I think they were a little beat down that tourism had come to a near standstill for the past five years. Most of the shops in the town were closed. Apparently, the Pope had come to bless that Church of the Nativity in 2000 and a bunch of people bought shops thinking that the Pope's visit would promote tourism. Then the Intifada started and everything came to a halt. It's quite sad. We got lucky on the way back in that we found an Israeli taxi that was willing to take us over the border and back to Jerusalem.</p>
