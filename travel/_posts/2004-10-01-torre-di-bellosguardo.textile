description: It turns out that getting in and out of Florence is not so easy. We decided to fly to Rome, take the train to Florence, and then take a cab to our hotel. So, yes, that meant that the first day of travel was kind of hellish. However, the hotel that greeted us at our arrival was WELL worth it! I think it was more than just the jet-lag - our hotel (the Torre di Bellosguardo) felt like a dream. And I don't mean to say that it was idyllic (although it was), it was like a dream when you're in a big house with hallways and stairwells going all different places.

<p>It turns out that getting in and out of Florence is not so easy. We decided to fly to Rome, take the train to Florence, and then take a cab to our hotel. So, yes, that meant that the first day of travel was kind of hellish. However, the hotel that greeted us at our arrival was WELL worth it! I think it was more than just the jet-lag - our hotel (the Torre di Bellosguardo) felt like a dream. And I don't mean to say that it was idyllic (although it was), it was like a dream when you're in a big house with hallways and stairwells going all different places. When the porter took us to our room, I got lost. I couldn't find any other hotel rooms! Our room was off of an old banquet hall and there didn't seem to be any other guest rooms off of it. (I did some exploring later in the week and we did find a few more rooms.)</p>

<p>And that takes us to our room. It was magnificent. It's the only hotel room that I've ever missed when I left. Everything was antique - even the artwork on the walls was medieval. We had two windows. Out of one window was an unbelievable view of Florence. Out of the other window was a view of the gardens. We could only hear two sounds really: an occassional church bell from Florence and a braying donkey. The donkey lived on the property. We went looking for him one day, but we never spotted him.</p>

<p>One day we took some time to explore the gardens of the property. It took us a while. They grew all their own fruits and vegetables. There were plenty of birds flittering about. There was also a pool, but we were more interested in exploring than hanging out by a pool. Also, October weather was not so hot that we felt the need to cool off by the water.</p>
