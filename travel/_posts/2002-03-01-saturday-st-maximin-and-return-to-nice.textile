description: We had a few outstanding items left in Aix. We had some museums to see still, and I wanted to get my hair cut in France. Since I had asked someone at work to write out directions to a hair stylist in French, I knew they would be disappointed if I didn't come back with a kooky French hairdo. We first went to Atelier Cezanne, which was the artist's painting studio. We visited the Museum Tapisserrie (Tapestry Museum).

<p>We had a few outstanding items left in Aix. We had some museums to see still, and I 

wanted to get my hair cut in France. Since I had asked someone at work to write out 

directions to a hair stylist in French, I knew they would be disappointed if I didn't come 

back with a kooky French hairdo. We first went to Atelier Cezanne, which was the 

artist's painting studio. We visited the Museum Tapisserrie (Tapestry Museum). And 

then I went to get my hair cut. I was very nervous, but it ended up being no big deal. 

They gave me some magazines and I pointed to a haircut and said, "Like this." It ended 

up being a very good haircut. I told the stylist (we communicated in broken English) that 

I would have to return to Aix in six weeks for my next haircut. I don't think he got it.</p>

<p>So then we hit side roads to go back to Nice. We had most of the day ahead of us, so we 

were still in tour mode. We stopped at a village that was on the way that ended up being a 

highlight of the trip. The Basilica of St. Maximin turns out to be the traditional burial 

place of Mary Magdalene. The chapel alone was magnificent - it was very well preserved 

during the French Revolution because Napoleon's younger brother used it as a storage 

depot and had the Marseillaise continuously played on the organ. However, the macabre 

highlight was the crypt where St. Maximin, St. Innocent, and Mary Magdalene were all 

buried. Mary Magdalene's crypt had a gold bust reliquary with the facemask gone, 

showing the skull of her remains. I really wanted to take a picture, but it seemed 

disrespectful.</p>

<p>Eventually, we ran out of quaint villages and hit the main highway back to Nice. We 

stayed at a different hotel room that was a little nicer. Our last meal in France was very 

good, but nothing too different than what we had been having.</p>
