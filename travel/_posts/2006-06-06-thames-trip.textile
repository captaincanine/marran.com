description: Our next day in London, David was chomping at the bit to go to Oxford. I told him that there was no way were getting on a train and fighting weekend crowds again. I would be up for a boat ride, but we had a hard time finding a boat trip that would go that far up the Thames.

<p><para para_guid="66bedf09-1685-4287-aa6a-283504feca98">Instead, we decided to go the opposite direction and catch a boat to Greenwich. I'm still not clear on whether Greenwich is just a neighborhood of London or an outer borough or what. Anyway, it's south east of London and you can get there via boat since it's right on the Thames.</para></p>

<p><para para_guid="f6040556-7686-4fbd-8a5a-333259f019ba">On the way to the ferry station, we passed by Buckingham Palace. There was a big crowd gathering just outside. We asked some people what they were waiting for. The first people we asked said that they saw the crowd and stopped but they didn't know either. Someone eventually told us that it was the Queen's 80th birthday.</para></p>
