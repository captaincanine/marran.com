Sitting on my desk, is a completely finished copy of my first comic book: Guinea Pigs. For a while, I changed the title to "The Four Last Things", but I think there's something fun and weird about "Guinea Pigs", so I'm keeping it for the time being.



It's a horror story about a group of children that were involved in an experiment at an amusement park many years ago. I won't go into a lot of detail about it here.



So it sits on my desk and I'm trying to work up the nerve to put it into a submission package to send to publishers. For some reason, this is the hard part. Actually, getting the comic book drawn, inked, colored and lettered was easy. I hired people to do the drawing and coloring. I did the lettering myself. Now I'm frozen in anticipation of sending it out. How do I package it for editors? Who should I send it out to? Should I include a box of cookies with the submission? Should I follow it up with phone calls to talk to them about it in depth? It feels like I'm just throwing a note in a bottle into the ocean in the hopes that someone stumbles across it.



Well, while I ponder these questions and tasks, I thought I'd post the first few pages of it. The color got a little washed out when I exported the images to jpg. Try to see past that. Here are the first 6 out of 22 action packed pages!
