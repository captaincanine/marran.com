description: Evan and Renee came by for a visit on President's Day Weekend. They came with Isaac and Elena (I guess they felt like having all blonde dogs). Gogo loved having everyone visit. She wanted to show off her tennis ball catching skills, but when I threw the tennis ball, Isaac appeared out of nowhere and snatched it in mid-air while Gogo was patiently waiting for it to come right to her. I gave a chew treat to Isaac after I got him to speak. I got a chew treat ready for Elena, and when I asked, "What tricks does Elena know?"

<p>Both Evan and Renee said at the same time, "Elena doesn't know any tricks."</p>

<p>"Hmmm," I thought. "That's not like Renee to not teach her dogs any tricks." This was clue number one that Renee is really a softie.</p>

<p>We ordered lunch, talked and relaxed. Elena came over and put her paws in my lap for some attention. I noticed that I now smelled like dog poop. Elena was tracking it all through the house. Evan took Elena in the bckyard to clean off her paws, Renee grabbed some cleaner and started cleaning the floor, and I went to change my pants. When I got back, Renee started grilling me:"</p>

<p>"Keith, this smells like kibble poop. Are you feeding Gogo kibble?"</p>

<p>"No, Renee. I have never fed Gogo kibble."</p>

<p>"What's that bag on the shelf? That's a bag of kibble!"</p>

<p>"We've had that bag as long as you've known us. It's the same size as it always is. It's leftover from our previous dog and we keep it in case of an emergency."</p>

<p>Luckily, I remembered that Gogo had spent last weekend at a kennel, and was fed kibble. I was off the hook as far as Renee was concerned. I was actually glad that it was kibble poop, becuase we could locate it via smell to clean it up.</p>

<p>So after that adventure, I was anxious to get all the dogs out fo the house. We went for a walk along Chelsea Piers. It was then that I saw my second clue that Renee is not the tough-mama that she claims to be. ISAAC PULLS ON THE LEASH AND RENEE DOESN'T DO ANYTHIGN ABOUT IT!! How many times has she teased me for being a softie and letting Gogo walk all over me? Well, I captured it all on camera.</p>

<p>We also had a fun little adventure when we first got to the water front. There's a four foot high concrete wall between the sidewalk and the water that's 10-15 feet below. Gogo wanted to see over the edge, so I lifted her up to look at the ducks and the water. Evan said, "Up, Gogo." and all of a sudden, in one leap, Isaac jumped up and over the wall. Renee screamed and held on to his leash and was afraid that she was now strangling him as he was dangling over the edge of a concrete wall. However, on the other side of the wall, is about one foot of space that Isaac had managed to land on. Isaac is very, very lucky.</p>

<p>After that we had a relaxing walk through the piers. Renee still insisted on teaching Isaac agility commands and had him jumping over benches and walking up and down steps. I started teaching Gogo a little bit of walking and jumping. And no one taught Elena anything - she just enjoyed the day.</p>
