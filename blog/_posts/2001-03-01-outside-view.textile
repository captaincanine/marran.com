description: So here we are. 218 W 15th St. Formerly the Bowery Mission Women's Home. To our east is a Catholic nursery. To our west is a building similar to ours, but broken into a million tiny apartments. David said that during the demolition, several people stopped by and said how happy they were to know that the house was being used as a family residence again. I guess those Bowery Mission Women were not the best neighbors.
