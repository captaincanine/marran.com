description: There is much confusion as to how the floors are numbered. The architect somewhat decided it for us by calling the first floor the ground floor and the second floor the first floor. This is how it's done in France - and now that we live in such a fancy building, we always have to be aware of how things are done in France. By the way, this is Benji's floor.
