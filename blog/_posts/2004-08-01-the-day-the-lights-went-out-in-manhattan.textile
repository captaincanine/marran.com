description: In August of 2004, there was a blackout on much of the Eastern seaboard of the United States. We were in Manhattan when it hit.

<p>Here's an interesting note that I found taped to a door. FYI - Queens is a LONG WAY AWAY! (Don't forget to click on the little magifying glass to see the details)</p>
