  Trying to remember my favorite albums from the 80's that still sound great to me today: Queen's "The Game", Prince's "Purple Rain", Police's "Synchronicity", Michael Jackson "Thriller", Cyndi Lauper's "She's So Unusual".
  
  Several albums I loved at the time that no longer do it for me: like Van Halen's "1984" and Def Leppard's "Pyromania" (though I love randomly singing "Fa-Fa-Fa-FOOLIN"). 
  
  Any additions?

    message: I was going to add that one to the list.  Also, Prince 1999.  'Let's Pretend We're Married' is still one of my favorite songs.
