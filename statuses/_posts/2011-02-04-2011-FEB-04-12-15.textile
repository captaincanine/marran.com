message: I have to make dinner for small gathering (<15 people). It has to be vegetarian and be relatively kid friendly. I kinda wanted to make good mac & cheese. I can't think what else to serve with it. Maybe tomato soup? Maybe a baked eggs dish (with spinach?)? Any suggestions?

    message: Def if you are making something heavy like mac and cheese start with something light and cool.  Salad with vinaigrette; tomato salad w/ cucumbers?  I've been digging on pears in salads lately.  The sweetness really counters a nice balsamic dressing

    message: lentil and ricotta patties can be placed in a burger bun and eaten like a hamburger or made into little bite size balls as a starter. Add a little curry to the mixture before cooking and they're yuuuummm!!
