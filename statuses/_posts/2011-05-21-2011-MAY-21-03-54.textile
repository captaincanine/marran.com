    message: That article is very...sad. It's sad that they can't see beyond themselves to experience another culture. However, going to Xian was like going to Scottsdale, AZ. Malls EVERYWHERE. The middle class is thriving. I think Western culture is invading China at an alarming rate. It's only a matter of time.
