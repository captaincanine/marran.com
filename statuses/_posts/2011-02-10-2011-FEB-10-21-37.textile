    message: What I'm more concerned about is the remake of the 1939 'Wizard of OZ' (no, not going to the actual book, but the 1939 movie script) and also the remake of "Highlander"  OY.

Well, I have been fearing this day for a long time, but at the same time, shocked that it didn't come sooner. They are remaking Logan's Run - one of my all-time favorite movies as a kid. The movie is a such a product of the 70's, I can't imagine what they'll do to it.
