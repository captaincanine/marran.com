message: So...I watched Miike's Audition two nights ago and I can't stop thinking about it. It was not the gore-fest horror movie I was expecting. It was an engaging, thoughtful and provoking film that also happened to be incredibly horrifying. The Japanese are so good at turning their deep-set fears into art.
