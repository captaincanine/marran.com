    message: wow! when we went there, we were fitted in a tiny, run down looking room filled floor to ceiling with fabrics, cardboard and a tiny sewing machine wedged in a corner. Interesting to go back and see the difference from13 yrs ago. looks great

    message: Yes, it was a big deal. They even made David take off his shirt in the middle of the store so they could take photos.
