message: "If I had to pick one Beatles song to save for eternity it would be \"Across the Universe\" and perhaps for no other reason than I can't figure the song out. Sometimes I think the phrase \"Nothing's gonna change my world\" is a statement of fact - that nothing can possibly change the world - where we are is where we have been and where we will always be. And sometimes I think it's something defiant: as if a cry to not let outside forces ruin the world we have created for ourselves. Whatever the meaning I seem to be getting at any time, the song always cuts through me every time I hear it."
