message: Last night, I drunkenly and smart-assedly commented that music sucked in the 90's. DJ Extraordinaire Dave Stringer Hughes floated the idea that I, perhaps, had no idea what I was talking about. And now he's forwarded me his Spotify playlist of 900 Great Songs of the 90's. We shall see (or hear, actually) who was right.

    message: If one thinks pop music in the 90's sucked then I would strongly disagree, but leave it at no more that a difference of opinion.  If however someone were to say that dance music in the 90's sucked I would say said person either had not heard a representative sample of it OR that they had such bad taste as to render their opinion laughably irrelevant to any further discussions of music.
