  Went to see The Loser's Lounge Tribute to Queen at Joe's Pub. It was AWESOME! I'm going to be listening to Queen songs for the next couple of weeks. I was surprised to hear a few songs that I had never heard before. I thought I knew all of Queen.
  
  Their next tribute night will be for Neil Diamond. You can bet I'm going to be there.
