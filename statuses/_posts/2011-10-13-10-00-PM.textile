    message: Kasabian is awesome.  I've always loved them.  I feel a bit weird about my latest favorite, Skrillex.  Who, in their right mind, is into dubstep when they're in their mid 40's?

    message: Glad to hear I'm not the only one. I sometimes feel like I'm supposed to be in my twenties and in London club when I listen to Kasabian. I'll check out Skrillex.
