message: I figured that I could live without Google Maps in iOS 6, but what I didn't realize is that they don't even tell you what subways are at each stop! Everything in the new Apple maps just shows as a generic subway stop. ARGH! Then I remembered that Google Maps works just fine in the mobile browser. C'mon, Apple. Step up your game.

    message: I agree. Have nothing like subway stops to keep track of here but the new map really is quite rubbish!
