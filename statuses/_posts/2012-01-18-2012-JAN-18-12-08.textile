      I walk by The Yard in Greenpoint a lot. It's close to the park, and about a >10 minute walk from the Bedford L train.

    message: I happened to be a few blocks from The Yard when you sent me this, so I checked it out. It was a great lobby! But the individual spaces were like white, beautifully architected coffins.

I think it's time for me to look for a cubicle to rent. Something to get me out of the house and free of distractions. What's the better neighborhood for that: DUMBO or Greenpoint?
