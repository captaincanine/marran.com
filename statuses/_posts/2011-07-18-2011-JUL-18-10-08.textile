    message: Something about this article bothers me.  I smell another media-invented culture war.  The author lays out a false choice - overprotective parent v. tiger mom, and implies that mainstream childrearing thought endorses the first.  Then the author retreats to anecdote to "prove" it.

This is a very interesting article, especially if you have kids. I think we have an ever-growing epidemic of optimism in this country that is doing us more harm than good.
