    message: My nephew is a couple of months shy of 6, so it's definitely okay for the 6 - 10 range. I was worried that it was going to be too long, but he followed it all the way to the end and only got a little fidgety in a couple of spots.

I took my nephew to see "Hugo" yesterday and "The Lion King" today. The lesson is: everyone that loves you will die someday soon.
