    message: I liked this article a lot. I take issue with the statement she makes that "Motherhood has a way of weeding out the lotharios," because I haven't found that to be largely true as of yet in my sparse yet 4-year dating career post-divorce. The man I dated for 3 1/2 years resented the fact that I had a child and wanted to spend time with Luke, for that took away attention from him. But he had Narcissistic Personality Disorder anyway...I identified with a couple of the buckets in the article anyway, Keith...

    message: I loved that article.  And Andrea - reading what you just wrote, I would say that motherhood DID weed out someone who wasn't a good partner for you.  A man who is worthy of being a partner of a single mom and a good step parent understands that children need attention and isn't resentful.  Good weeding. :-)

link-info: If you're having sex outside committed relationships, you will have to stop.  Why?  Because past a certain age, casual sex is like recreational heroin -- it doesn't stay recreational for long.
