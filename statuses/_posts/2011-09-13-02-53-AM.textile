  On the flight to Tel Aviv, our steward offered fresh pita bread and David said "No pita for me." 
  Steward: You have hummus. In Israel, we always eat hummus with pita.
  David: I know. I don't want pita bread. 
  Steward: You know you are on a flight to Israel, right? Take a pita.
  David: I have a mother in Philadelphia. She's better at this than you. 
  
  Then the steward laughed and left him alone. He offered me a pita. I took it.

    message: I literally can hear this conversation. I love that Keith took the practical approach and just accepted the pita whether he intended to eat it or not.
