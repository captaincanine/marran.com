    message: Content providers just have to get their shit together.  I hate cable and am so happy to not have it.  I am perfectly happy paying for a series that is underway, even waiting a week or so to see each episode.  But making me wait months or even years to watch something kills the buzz and leaves me out of the public consciousness of a show which = rapid disinterest.  And it will never ever ever get me to buy cable.

    message: Agreed!  The three of us watch a total of about five shows. Why bother with the rest.  I would love to be able to order only what we want.

link-info: A big thanks to my friend Rebecca for coining the term "CuntHammer" when describing Queen Cersei. 	If you have issues with my usage of the C word, please take it up with her. Or just go read this comic.
