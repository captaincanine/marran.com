    message: Honestly Keith I think there is a rise in teen suicide nation wide. My husbands co worker just lost his 14 year old son right here in the heart of the Liberal west coast.  I find it unfair to finger point at this individual and blame her policies, with out data to support the 'epidemic' contrasted with national, or even global data.

    message: "I certainly don't think Michelle Bachmann is responsible for the suicides of the teens mentioned in this article (though I find her comments about teen bullying disappointingly unsympathetic). And while teen suicide happens in liberal areas, 9 students in one district over the course of two years is a LOT. The original article talks more about what was going on with the students and the school district and is definitely worth a read: http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/07/michele-bachmann-teen-suicide. (It's good to note that a theater teacher was one of the adults trying to create a safe-haven for students - gay and straight.)"
