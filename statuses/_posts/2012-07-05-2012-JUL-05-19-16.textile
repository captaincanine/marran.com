    message: Keith - the video made me laugh; your comments made me a little bit misty-eyed.  I still have very fond memories of our time in HS.  You're right.  Our little "family" of misfits got us all through a lot of the teenage angst, alienation and "otherness."  So glad you were a part of it.  How are things?

link-info: "Dan Savage started the It Gets Better Project because he wished he could speak to all those LGBT teenagers having a rough time of it in school and at home. Well, this filmmaker has a novel take on that subject. He talks to his twelve-year-old self, twenty years in the future. "
