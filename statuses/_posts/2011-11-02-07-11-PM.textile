    message: I would weep with joy if I never again had to write crappy hack code to deal with IE. Maybe that just means I should change professions.

    message: I feel the same. Microsoft owes me hours and hours of time that I've spent trying to work around their product. And every time they release a new version, they say "This one is going to be 100% compliant" and it never is.

    message: However there are certain websites that never work quite right with Firefox or Safari and on my pc at work, I'll revert to using IE when nothing else will quite do it.
