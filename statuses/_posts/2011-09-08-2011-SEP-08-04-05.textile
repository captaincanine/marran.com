    message: Welcome back, Jie! A friend of mine suggested that jet lag is like when you spin too much in one direction - you have to spin a little bit in the other direction to center yourself. So go to Europe for a few days and when you get back the jet lag is gone! (I'm going to Israel tomorrow.)
