  Having a conversation with someone about books and/or movies that truly shocked/disturbed/offended me when I experienced them. For books, I'm drawing a blank. For movies, "Salo" definitely shattered me beyond what I thought was possible. And "Blood Sucking Freaks" comes as a close second (though BSF somehow seems too playful to be taken seriously). 
  
  I'm sure I must be forgetting some. Anyone have any suggestions?

    message: Leslie, while I loved Bjork and the songs in "Dancer in the Dark," that movie made me hate Lars van Trier.  It was only through relentless coaxing that I saw, Dogville and loved it.  I agree.  I would unwatch "Dancer."  Such a fever pitch of misery that was impossible not be effected by, but, IMHO, truly underserved and emotionally and intellectually dishonest.  HATED that movie.

      I never saw "Dancer in the Dark" because it sounded gratuitously depressing. I will stick with that decision. 
      
      And I will put the knitting needles away when I watch Dogville and give it my full attention. 
      
      Thanks.
