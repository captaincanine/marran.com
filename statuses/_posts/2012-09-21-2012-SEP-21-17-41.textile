Granted, I have no compelling reason to switch to Android or Windows, but I wish Apple would build in use of widgets so I can customize my home screen to whatever I want. It feels like Apple's phone and not like my phone.

    message: I suspect that Apple is going through a phase now in which they are trying to be very respectful of what Steve wanted. They don't want to mess up the legacy. They seem to be playing it very safe. I think that phase will eventually end and they'll loosen up and start doing fun things again.

    message: So while he actually said "I have an extra row [on the home screen]," what I heard Thomas Rogers say as he set up his new iPhone was "I'm Esther Rolle!"

    message: If iOS allowed you to become your favorite Good Times character...then I think I would take back every mean thing I ever said about Apple.
