    message: "Thanks! It took me 3 days, but you're probably faster than I am. Also, I used this wool which I highly recommend: http://www.thefibreco.com/roadtochina.html. Super soft and not itchy at all."

    message: Nice!  Crochet is quicker than knitting... It will take me a little time to translate the knit stitches to crochet, after that it's a cinch!

link-info: I just finished my latest knitting project. This was a hat I made for a friend. It's based on The Boyfriend Hat. I've found it to be a good, all-purpose winter hat project with some modifications. This is made from a super-soft merino wool.
