    message: Thanks for the compliments on the hat and the 'stache. I had been calling it my Rajasthani mustache, because that's where i was when I was inspired to grow it. Now I think I'll call it my pornstache. And Sarah - you had mentioned ravelry.com when I was having problems with gloves. It's a great site and I've been posting my projects.

    message: howdy! did you use circular needles to make the hat? I am about to tackle  my first beanie project with circular needles. Have a feeling I'll end up with a bright red tea cosy instead...
