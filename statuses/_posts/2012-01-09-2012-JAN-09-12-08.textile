    message: Nice blog, brother.  I've made paneer about five times and have it down to an easy 20 minutes.  Boil  1/2 gal. milk for 1 minute, take it off boil, cut a lemon in half, squirt all the juice in, wait five minutes, take out curds, put them in cheesecloth, squeeze out the excess liquid, add cumin and salt, make a tofu style cake with it, fry it up briefly, cut it into cubes, toss it in with spinach, tomatoes and ginger that you've fried and make a nan sandwich!

link-info: I've just gotten sick for the third time this winter. It's time for a change to the diet. At this point last year I was still on my high from India and was not eating any meat. And I didn't get sick once last year!
