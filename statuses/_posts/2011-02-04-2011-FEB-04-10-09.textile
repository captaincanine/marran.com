message: I took my nephew to see "Spider-Man" on Broadway and he was beyond excited. As we shuffled into the theater with hundreds of other people, he said "All these people are here to see Spider-Man?" I said yes and got a little choked up sharing a Spider-Man moment with my nephew. I couldn't decide if it was because I was exhausted, or because I love my nephew, or because I'm a true comic book geek, or a big softie.
