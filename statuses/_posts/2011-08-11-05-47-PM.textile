    message: Holy shit.  I had not heard about that.  There is an embedded video in the comments that is excruciating.  I know it sounds naive, but it really is astonishing to me that someone could be so cynical with human life.  Not nameless faceless people, but kids right in front of him.  Seriously.  It is easy to wish him real, physical and emotional harm.
