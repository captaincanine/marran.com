    message: Cambodia still remains one of one favorite trips around Asia ! It s still very much untouched. We stayed at the Victoria hotel in Siem Reap which I very highly recommend. Beautiful rooms and u can have a view over the park full of trees with hanging flying foxes. Very neat !I should download some of pictures I took then....

    message: Our first trip together was to Vietnam in 1998 and I vowed that if I still liked Paulie after spending 3 weeks back packing around the Vietnamese country side with him, I would marry him!!! The whole trip cost us $2000, but we did do it rough. Any chance of concluding your trip with an Aussie visit....?

David and I just booked our big travel for this year: a trip through Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia! Woo-hoo! Unlike some of our recent big excursions, I have very few expectations or pre-conceived notions of these countries. The only thing that people have told be is to expect it to be hot.
