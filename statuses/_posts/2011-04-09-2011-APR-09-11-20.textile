While it was fun, the Broadway people totally out-did the TV people. Not surprising, I guess."

    message: At the end of "Here's to the Ladies Who Lunch," Patti LuPone was on the apron of center stage. On her final "RISE!" she threw her arms up and purposefully doused the first three rows of the audience with the contents of her martini glass. It was great.
