    message: Neither do I. ;) I guess the phrasing of "never thought I would say this" got to me and made me wonder if people EVER think of things they wouldn't say prior to having said them. Does that make sense? Sorry that my over-thinking weirdness spilled onto your post... I never thought it would ;)
