    message: For the record, I am on my second lunch (salad). I forgot how a hunger-inducing a new regimen can be.

    message: When I used to watch Gillian McKeith's show, she would often point out to new dieters that a good diet is healthy foods in abundance. It should not be a starvation diet. And her clients would lose 30 pounds in 8 weeks. So go for that second salad! I'm waiting for a Fresh Direct delivery to replenish my fridge after coming home from vacation.

    message: Healthy foods in abundance vs. lots of strong black coffee (a.k.a. the Fashion Editor Diet)
