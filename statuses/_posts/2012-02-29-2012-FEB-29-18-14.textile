message: I watched this segment and went from laughing to deeply saddened by our modern world. I hate to sound like Abe Simpson. I won't say the world was "better" when I was younger, but I think it was a lot more fun being a kid before the corporations completely took over.

    message: I share your annoyance on this one.  The Lorax is near Talmudic (is that a word?) in its simplicity and depth.  It would be so easy it make a clean, uncluttered and (reasonably) pure movie of it.  I think there is no indication that happened.  I rarely feel defensive of childhood (or, in this case, adulthood) memories, but it is offensive that they took the route they took.
