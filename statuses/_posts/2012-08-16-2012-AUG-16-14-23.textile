I saw something new: one of them was cleaning a mini-sub on one of the yachts. It had a huge glass dome like something out of a 70s James Bond movie. So apparently super villains dock their yachts at Chelsea Piers."

This morning the dogs and I took a walk through Chelsea Piers. We watched the deck hands in their white polo shirts and shorts cleaning the yachts. I saw something new: one of them was cleaning a mini-sub on one of the yachts. It had a huge glass dome like something out of a 70s James Bond movie. So apparently super villains dock their yachts at Chelsea Piers.
