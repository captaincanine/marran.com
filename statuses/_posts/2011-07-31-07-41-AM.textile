    message: I never saw it either, but it's s'posed to be great. Nicholas Roeg (Don't Look Now) co-directed it...

    message: Great video and great song.  IMHO, iffy movie.  I mean, an awesome and telling time-capsule to be sure.  but kind of clunky and hard to watch.  Well, it's been a while.  I should watch it again before I express too strong of an opinion.
