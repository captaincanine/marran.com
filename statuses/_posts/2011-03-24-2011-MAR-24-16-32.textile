    message: Nice. We did the same thing a little over a year ago and haven't looked back. Thought about getting the Mac Mini, but so far we're totally content with just an Apple TV.

    message: We bought an AppleTV when the 2nd generation came out. It's a great device. Our only big complaint is that we couldn't download Jeopardy, which is one of our mainstays. So we decided to put an antenna on the roof and get over-the-air HDTV. In order to record Jeopardy, we had to go the Mac Mini/EyeTV route.
