message: I'm trying to make a decent chocolate filling out of lemon myrtle and macadamia nuts and so far it ain't happening. If any of my friends down under could provide a suggestion, I'm all ears.

I'm trying to make a decent chocolate filling out of lemon myrtle and macadamia nuts and so far it ain't happening. If any of my friends down under could provide a suggestion, I'm all ears. I tried a white chocolate ganache and it tasted bland and slightly unsettling. Now I'm trying a nougatine.
