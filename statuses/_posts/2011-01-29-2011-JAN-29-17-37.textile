  There's a Ken Russell film based on a Aldous Huxley book called "The Devils". It's about a priest that was executed based on demon possessions of nuns.
  
  It was banned all over the world. You can't buy a DVD of it on Amazon. It's not on Netflix. However, I can download the uncensored version illegally - which I am doing.
  
  The movie industry really knows how to shoot itself in the foot.
