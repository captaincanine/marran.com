    message: LOL - I know.  I annoy myself sometimes when I do a quick point and shoot with my iPhone and like the shot better than anything I've taken recently with my "high end" equipment!  Just not fair!  Sounds like your nephew might have a promising career ahead - the artistic eye develops early :-)
