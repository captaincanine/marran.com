So, Keith is turning <span class="redacted">redacted</span> years old! And he's celebrating with a little party. I hope you can attend. There will be the usual food and drink. Possibly another batch of brownies from last year - but no promises.

The festivities take place on...

<small>at</small> 218 West 15th St <small>(between 7th and 8th)</small>

<div style="margin-top: 1em">

And I'm doing something a little special that you need to know about for the R.S.V.P.

I have picked out a play that is hilarious, dark, and something I'm pretty sure you've never seen before. It's written by Christopher Durang whom I think is one of the more underrated American playwrights.

I'd like to have a play reading. It's something I've been thinking of for a while.

Let me know if you'd like to be one of the actors. We'll just be sitting, so all you have to do is read from a script. There are big(-ish) parts and small parts. No acting skills required, though if you have an inner Meryl Streep, this is your chance to shine. I think I need about 5 readers if I double up on roles, but I can go up to 10 or more if there's interest. It's an easy way for you to get laughs and applause.

We'll start the reading around 9 or 10pm. After the cast has had a chance to vocalize.

h3. What can you bring?

Well, just yourself, please. And any guests that might want to come along. No gifts, please, but if you wanted to bring some gogo boys, I don't think anyone would complain. Especially if they're wearing giant, spangly bow ties.

h3. Be sure to R.S.V.P. on the right<br/> or send me an email at keith (at) marran (dot) com.
